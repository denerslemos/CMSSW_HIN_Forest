# CMSSW Heavy Ion Forest Intructions
This repository was created for students that are starting analysis and would like to learn about Forest framework.

## Forest framework
In summary the forest is a code written in C++ and python that contain all the objects to perform a physics analysis in CMS. It is basicaly a CMSSW analyzer that create Ntuples/TTrees from ROOT with many branchs divided in different folders. The structure of the code is the kept similar since a long time ago and the high-pT group is usualy responsible for that. Usualy a contact person is designed to work on the code together with other groups.
